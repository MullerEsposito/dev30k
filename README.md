Stellar Message Signer it's an application that convert a string message to base64 and soon after it signs that base64 message with the private key of a Stellar wallet. Once we have the signed message, you can interact with the console and type the input regard to the network you'd like to send the transaction. From this moment, if we have no unpredictables, your transaction already can be checked in the scanbook.
